			Introduction

		p(class="mainText").
			There is no denying that we are currently experiencing a world with prosperity and advanced that are unlike any of the years that have come before. We live with technological marvels that make our jobs easier so we have time to engage in pursuits that didn't even exist a couple of decades ago. Perhaps because of this, it is important that we don't become complacent. There is no reason to cut ourselves off from technology, but inversely it is foolish to become dependent upon it. The one technology that would be hardest for most of us to lose is the internet. Aside from being a social and communication tool, it is where we go for some many of our questions and tutorials. SurvivalPi aims to be a backup library should you lose access to the global network.<br>

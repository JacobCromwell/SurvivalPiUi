</h2><p class="mainText">There is no denying that we are currently experiencing a world with prosperity and advanced that are unlike any of the years that have come before. We live with technological marvels that make our jobs easier so we have time to engage in pursuits that didn't even exist a couple of decades ago. Perhaps because of this, it is important that we don't become complacent. There is no reason to cut ourselves off from technology, but inversely it is foolish to become dependent upon it.
